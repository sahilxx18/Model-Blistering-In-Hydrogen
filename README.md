# Model-Blistering-In-Hydrogen
Objective:
Develop a mathematical model coupled with phase-field modeling to simulate and analyze hydrogen-induced blistering in metals. This phenomenon is critical to understanding hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) in materials.

Introduction:
Discusses hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms like Hydrogen Enhanced Decohesion (HEDE) and Hydrogen Enhanced Localized Plasticity (HELP).
Emphasizes degradation of mechanical properties due to hydrogen's interaction with metals.

Research Gap:
Highlights the absence of comprehensive models explaining blistering physics and limited simulation-based studies in literature.

Methodology:
Formulation of a mathematical model incorporating phase-field fracture modeling.
Use of ABAQUS subroutines for elastic-plastic stress calculations.
Simulations based on Fickâ€™s laws of diffusion to analyze hydrogen transport.

Simulation Results:
Successfully captured blister formation and stress-strain distributions.
Two case studies showing how flux variations affect blistering dynamics.

Conclusion:
Developed a coupled model that accurately tracks blister formation.
Demonstrated potential for simulation-based studies to address research gaps.

Future Scope:
Implementation of advanced subroutines to integrate phase-field modeling for more comprehensive simulations.
